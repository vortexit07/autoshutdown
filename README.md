# !! IMPORTANT - Repo Deprecated!!
Looking back at this repo, now knowing so much more about programming, my code is absolutely horrendous. I have restarted the project from scratch and will be updating the new repo which you can find [here](https://github.com/vortexit07/AutoShutdown-v0.3). Please do not install this spaghetti code, I don't want your PC to get fat.
